# Using ADR to track decisions - 23/02/2022

## Context

I want to document and track all decisions made on the project

## Decision

To start using an ADR.md file for each important decision that I make. ie:

- choose-database.md
- format-timestamps.md
- handle-exceptions.md

The name convention will be:

- present tense imperative verb (help readability + same commit message format)
- kebab case
- extension markdown

## Consequences

I will spend a little more time doing the project, but it can be useful to the future me to see if a decision was good or bade and repeat it (or not) on future projects.

Also anyone can know why I did everything the way it is.
