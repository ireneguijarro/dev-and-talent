# How are logs and errors going to be handled - 24/02/2022

## Context

I want logs and errors to be handled on a single platform.

## Decision

To use Rollbar since it's the one used on JT, so I can learn from it to work in a real project.

## Consequences

So much easier to track logs and errors, in one platform and with many possibilities, also Rollbar has integrations like email.
